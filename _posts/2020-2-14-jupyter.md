We want to use the jupyter notebook in the remote server.

## 1.Set password
Execute `ipython`.
```python
In [1]: from notebook.auth import passwd
In [2]: passwd()
Enter password:
Verify password:
Out[2]: 'sha1:8e571a9408f9:6db9d90006692cf665fd206664f2a28e2d9f7582'
```

## 2. Modify configuration file
Open the file `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` via `vim` or others, and add the following contents.
```python
c.NotebookApp.ip='localhost'
c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:8e571a9408f9:6db9d90006692cf665fd206664f2a28e2d9f7582'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.port = 8570
```

## 3. Initialize jupyter notebook
In the server, execute `jupyter notebook`.

## 4. Set up a link from localhost to the remote server
In local system, execute the following command
```bash
ssh -f -N -L localhost:8888:localhost:8570 shanjiawei2019@10.224.255.112
```
The visit `http://localhost:8888` in the browser.

## Simplify -- autoconnnection 
First install `expect` via `sudo apt install expect`, then create file `~/.script_ssh/jupyter_notebook_isbd.sh` and input the following contents.
```bash
#!/usr/bin/expect
set timeout 20
set password "yourpassword"
spawn ssh -L localhost:8887:localhost:8570 -f -N -p 5102 shanjiawei2019@10.224.255.112
expect "*password:"
send "$password\n"
interact
```

Then add in the file `~/.bashrc`
```bash
alias ipynb="wslview http://localhost:8888; ~/.script_ssh/jupyter_notebook_isbd.sh"
```
and operate `source ~/.bashrc`.

Later it is suffices to operate `ipynb` when you want to use jupyter notebook.
