We want to use the jupyter notebook in the remote server.

## 1.Set password
Execute `ipython`.

**Note:** If the command is not found, we should add its directory to PATH via `PATH=$PATH:/opt/anaconda3/bin`, or enter the directory via `cd /opt/anaconda3/bin` and then execute `./ipython`.

```python
In [1]: from notebook.auth import passwd
In [2]: passwd()
Enter password:
Verify password:
Out[2]: 'sha1:8e571a9408f9:6db9d90006692cf665fd206664f2a28e2d9f7582'
```

## 2. Modify configuration file
Edit the file `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` via `vim` or others, and add the following contents.
```python
c.NotebookApp.ip='localhost'
c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:8e571a9408f9:6db9d90006692cf665fd206664f2a28e2d9f7582'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.port = 8570
```

## 3. Initialize jupyter notebook
In the server, execute `jupyter notebook`.

## 4. Set up a link from localhost to the remote server
In local system, execute the following command
```bash
ssh -L localhost:8887:localhost:8570 -f -N -p port user@host
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8888` in the browser.

## Simplify -- autoconnnection 
First install `expect` via `sudo apt install expect`, then create file `~/.script_ssh/jupyter_notebook_isbd.sh` and input the following contents.
```bash
#!/usr/bin/expect
set timeout 20
set password "yourpassword"
spawn ssh -L localhost:8887:localhost:8570 -f -N -p port user@host
expect "*password:"
send "$password\n"
interact
```

Then add the following command in the file `~/.bashrc`
```bash
alias ipynb="wslview http://localhost:8888; ~/.script_ssh/jupyter_notebook_isbd.sh"
```
Execute `source ~/.bashrc`.

Later it is suffices to operate `ipynb` when you want to use jupyter notebook.

## Another Method 

Write above commands in a `.sh` file. Particularly, create a file `~/.jupyter_isbd.sh` containing the following commands:

```bash
wslview http://localhost:8887
~/.script_ssh/jupyter_notebook_isbd.sh
```

Then create a `.bat` file with command `bash ~/.jupyter_isbd.sh`. It suffices to double-click to open it when you need to connect the server.
