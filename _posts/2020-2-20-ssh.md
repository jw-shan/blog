A simplified method to log in a remote server.

## Package

First, the package `expect` is required.

```bash
sudo apt install expect
```

## Script

Then create a script for auto-connection via `vim ./script_ssh/isbd.sh` (any other directory and name you want).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/expect
set timeout 20
set password "xxxxxx" #your password
spawn ssh -p port user@host
expect "*password:"
send "$password\n"
interact
```

## Alias

Edit `~/.bashrc` and add the following lines

```bash
alias isbd='./script_ssh/isbd.sh`'
```

Execute `source ~/.bashrc` to take  it effect.

## Log in

Input `isbd` only.
