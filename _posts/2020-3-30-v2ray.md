When using V2rayN, some problems occurred:

- The formula of Wikipedia cannot display normally
- Github is not in the default proxy rules, resulting in a slow access speed

To solve these problem, we can use the global proxy. A better method is to modify the PAC rules by adding the following lines, then use the PAC mode:

```
||wikipedia.org,
||wikimedia.org,
||github.com^,
||avatars*.githubusercontent.com
```
