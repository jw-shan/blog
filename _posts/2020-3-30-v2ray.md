When using V2rayN, some problems occurred:

- The formula of Wikipedia cannot display normally
- Github is not in the default proxy rules, resulting a slow access speed

To solve these problem, we can use the global proxy. A better method is to modify the PAC rule by adding the following lines:

```
||wikipedia.org,
||wikimedia.org,
||github.com^,
||avatars*.githubusercontent.com
```
